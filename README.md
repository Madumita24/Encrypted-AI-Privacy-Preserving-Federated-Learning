# Encrypted-AI-Privacy-Preserving-Federated-Learning
This project simulates a real-world federated learning setup for detecting suspicious user behavior using synthetic regional login/session data â€” all while preserving data privacy by avoiding centralized data collection.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Goal:** Detect abnormal login behavior without sharing raw data
- **Approach:** Use federated learning (with Flower) to train a shared model across distributed synthetic clients (regions)
- **Tech:** Python, TensorFlow, Flower, Pandas, Matplotlib

## ðŸ§  Features

- Federated learning simulation with 5 clients (Region_A to Region_E)
- No raw data leaves local clients
- Centralized vs. federated accuracy comparison
- Visualization of accuracy per round
- Full automation script to launch server + clients
